# Q-Learning

A low learning curve implementation of Q-learning.

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/qlearning)](https://pypi.org/project/Simple-Q/)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/qlearning)](https://github.com/Nesta-gitU/Simple-Q/Simple-Q/LICENSE).

Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that allows an agent to learn an optimal policy for sequential decision-making problems. This implementation provides an easy-to-use and beginner-friendly approach to Q-learning, making it accessible to users with varying levels of experience. This implementation is build to work with "GYM" environments from the [Gymnasium Project](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) 

## Features

- Provides flexibility to work with either integer or custom objects for states and actions.
- Offers customizable learning rate and exploration-exploitation trade-off parameters.
- Implements epsilon-greedy strategy for action selection.
- Supports polynomial and power decay functions for learning rate and exploration parameter respecitively. 
  The learning rate decay is based on the research in Even-Dar et al. (2003). When lambda is in (0,1) this implementation of Q-learning satisfies the conditions for probability one convergence in Watkins and Dayan (1992).

## Installation

Install the `Simple-Q` package from PyPI:

```shell
pip install Simple-Q
```

## Usage

```python
from Simple-Q import Qlearning

# Create the Q-learning agent
agent = Qlearning(states=10, actions = ['forward', 'left', 'right' 'stop'])

# Use the Q-learning agent in your reinforcement learning loop
state = env.reset()
N = 100
for n in range(N):
    action = agent.get_action(state)
    next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
    agent.update_q_table(state, action, reward, next_state)
    state = next_state
    agent.update_epsilon()
```

## Documentation

The Q-Learning class provides the following parameters:

| Parameter             | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `states`              | Number of states or a list of immutable objects representing states. If a list is passed, the states are mapped to integers starting from 0, and the immutable objects (not indices) are expected as input for the other methods. |
| `actions`             | Number of actions or a list of immutable objects representing actions. If a list is passed, the actions are mapped to integers starting from 0, and the immutable objects (not indices) are expected as input for the other methods. |
| `alpha`               | Learning rate parameter. If `'polynomial'`, a polynomial decay is used. If `int` or `float`, a fixed value is used. |
| `w`                   | Decay exponent for the polynomial decay. Only applicable when `alpha='polynomial'`. |
| `gamma`               | Discount factor for future rewards.                          |
| `epsilon_decay`       | Epsilon decay function. If `'power'`, a power decay is used. |
| `epsilon`             | Initial value for the exploration-exploitation trade-off parameter. |
| `epsilon_decay_factor`| Decay factor for epsilon. Determines how it decays over time. |
| `epsilon_min`         | Minimum value for epsilon.                                   |

The Q-Learning class provides the following attributes:

| Attribute  | Description                                                  |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `q_table`  | Q-table storing the learned Q-values for state-action pairs. |
